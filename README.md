Objective: Create a game showing off jQuery skills.


## Overview
"Gem Collector" is a game that tests the user's math and deduction skills to collect a combination of gems to match a target number. The values of each gem are hidden from the user and randomly generated per round.


## Instructions
1. Click the "Start New Game" to activate the game and you will be given a target number in the right hand panel.

2. Click the gem stones to increase the current number. Each gem will increase your current total by a different hidden value. For example the amethyst may increase your total by 5, but the ruby may increase the value by 9.

3. To win the game, collect the right amount of gems to exactly match the target number. When you exceed the target number, you lose the game. 

4. To play a new game, simply click the "Start New Game" button when it reappears. For each new game the current and target values will reset and you will be given a new target number. The value for each gem will update as well. Click wisely!

* Google font, Audiowide, for the header.

## Future Recommendation
* Consider create some animation to make the game appear more dynamic. 

* The header background was initially the body's background, but I need to come account for the image shifting once the button disappears.
